# raspberry-pi-iot
Using my Raspberry Pi to create my own home automation/IoT concepts.

SmartLamp.py
 a. Uses the Weather Underground api.
 b. The api is free, but can't be polled too often. Which is why I update the time for sunset every 3rd day.
 c. This is using a Power Switch Tail 2, which can be purchased from Adafruit or Amazon.
